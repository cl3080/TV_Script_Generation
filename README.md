# TV Script Generation

## Overview
This is a capstone project for Udacity nanodegree on Deep Learning. In this project, I used the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons and build a RNN model to generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts.

## Project 
The project was performed as following steps:
* **Step 1**: Implement Pre-processing Functions: Lookup Table for word embedding and Tokenize Punctuation to clean up words.
* **Step 2**: Build RNN using Pytorch. For this project, I used LSTM.
* **Step 3**: Train the LSTM models and fine-tune the parameters.
* **Step 4**: Validate the model's performance and generate sample TV scripts.

The details for each step can be found in this jupyter notebook:
